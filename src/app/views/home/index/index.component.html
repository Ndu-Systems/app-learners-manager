      A culture of high expectations and a commitment to nurturing the talents and developing the gifts of every
      student underpins the culture of Mthombisi High School. We are student centred with a strong focus on
      individuals. Teachers offer many opportunities to stretch and challenge all, including the most able.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      Exceptional teaching is the building block of our success. We blend the traditional with the innovative to give
      our students the best experiences in the classroom, laboratory or on the playing field.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      We monitor studentsâ€™ progress carefully at all key stages. Quite simply, our aspiration is that every student
      makes exceptional progress; those who would benefit from additional support in any aspect of their learning and
      those with marked aptitudes are identified early and given specialist support to reach their full potential.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      We emphasise the engagement of learning within a caring, purposeful and stimulating environment where every
      student is encouraged to succeed. We embrace the language and culture of South Africa to prepare our students for
      their career life.
