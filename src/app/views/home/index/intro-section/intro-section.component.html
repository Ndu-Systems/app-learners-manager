          Exceptional teaching is the building block of our success. We blend the traditional with the innovative to give
          our students the best experiences in the classroom, laboratory or on the playing field.
        </p>
      <p>
        A culture of high expectations and a commitment to nurturing the talents and developing the gifts of every
        student underpins the culture of Siphiwe Secondary School. We are student centred with a strong focus on
        individuals. Teachers offer many opportunities to stretch and challenge all, including the most able.

      <!-- <p>
        We monitor studentsâ€™ progress carefully at all key stages. Quite simply, our aspiration is that every student
        makes exceptional progress; those who would benefit from additional support in any aspect of their learning and
        those with marked aptitudes are identified early and given specialist support to reach their full potential.
      </p> -->
      <!-- <p>
        We emphasise the engagement of learning within a caring, purposeful and stimulating environment where every
        student is encouraged to succeed. We embrace the language and culture of South Africa to prepare our students
        for
        their career life.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have an experienced, superb staff who educate and inspire. It is our hope that you will be excited by our
        school and that your daughter will embrace our core values of love, community, integrity.
